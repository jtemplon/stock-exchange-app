## The Mid-Major Madness Stock Exchange App

This is the app framework for the Mid-Majors Madness Stock Exchange. In order to run the app you will need the following files that are not included in this repository: `.env`, `.flaskenv`, `app.db`.

The Mid-Major Madness Stock Exchange was conceived by Chris Schutte and John Templon. John programmed the app and if you have questions about it you can reach him at [nycbuckets@gmail.com](mailto:nycbuckets@gmail.com).

A big thanks to Miguel Grinberg and [The Flask Mega-Tutorial](https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/the-flask-mega-tutorial-part-i-hello-world) for providing a framework for building an app. (Any errors are of course not attributable to him, but John's own work.)
